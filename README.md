## Process

* Fork this repository to your personal GitHub account. If you prefer, you may create your own private repository instead.
* Complete your project and push your code to your repository.
* Send a link to your public repo or invite [@raylenmargono](https://github.com/raylenmargono) as collaborators if it is private.

## Exercise

Leverage a CI/CD of your choice to dockerize and build the provided application and deploy
onto the cloud infrastructure of your choice. Provision your infrastructure using
an infrastructure as code tool (e.g. Terraform).

The application should be reachable via an ip address and respond
with the message "I AM ALIVE!" in the root path (already defined in the application).

## Requirements

* Application should run as a Docker container
* Application should be reachable via ip address
* Use your choice of CI/CD solution or other tools to build
* Use your choice of Free tier cloud infrastructure to run
* Use Terraform to manage cloud resources
* We are more interested in the infrastructure as code to build and deploy, not the details of the app

## Interview

* You will walk through your solution
* We will discuss solutions and challenges of implementation
* Additional technical questions and discussion
